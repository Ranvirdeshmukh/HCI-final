- Group 3: Social + Financial reminders (n=10)
- T-tests conducted to determine statistical significance

### Key Findings
- Group 3 (Social + Financial): 4.71 avg. tasks completed, 100% likely to continue
- Group 2 (Social only): 2.86 avg. tasks completed, 50% likely to continue  
- Group 1 (Digital only): 1.14 avg. tasks completed, 71.4% likely to continue
- Statistical significance: p = 0.00028 (Groups 1 vs 2), p = 7.51 × 10⁻⁸ (Groups 1 vs 3)
